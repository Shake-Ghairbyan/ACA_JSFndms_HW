 Recursion
1. Write a recursive function to determine whether all digits of the number are odd or not.
  
2. Given an array of numbers. Write a recursive function to find its minimal positive element. (if such element does not exist, return -1).

3. Given an array of numbers which is almost sorted in ascending order. Find the index where sorting order is violated.

          
4. Given an array. Write a recursive function that removes the first element and returns the given array. (without using ​arr.shift()​)
          
5. Given an array and a number N. ​ ​Write a recursive function that rotates an array N places to the left. (​Hint:​ to add element to the beginning use ​arr.unshift()​)
