 1. Given a phone number. Write a function to clean it up, so it is valid. The rules are as follows:
If the phone number is less than 10 digits assume that it is a bad number
If the phone number is longer than 10, then it is a bad number
If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good
If the phone number consists of 11 symbols and the first one is + and others are numbers, then trim + and return remaining 10 digits.
If the phone number contains + symbol more than one, consider it as a bad number. If the phone number contains + symbol not as the first character, consider it as a bad number.
Ignore spaces between digits.

  
2. Write a function, which will receive a number between 0 to 999,999 and spell out that number in English.
